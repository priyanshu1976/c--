OOPS -> (object oriented programming principles)
1. Object is an instance of class
2. Empty class has 1 byte memory to keep a track of its existence
3. Padding : adding extra space to a class for faster access 
eg class animal{
    char a;
    int b;
    int c;
};
size of class animal is 4+4+4=12 not 1+4+4=9 bcuz by allocating 3 extra bytes to the char a, we create divisions of 4 which works faster in memory than the previous alignment

4. Greedy Alignment : We create larger datatype variables in the starting to increase speed and efficiency

5 . By deafault , members are marked as private in a class
6 . We use getter and setter functions to access private values of a class
